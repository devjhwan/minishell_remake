[Norm]

Hi hitchhikers,
I have a question about norm, specifically static variables.
I am currently attempting to make a struct work like a C++ class.
What I am trying to do is create a function that contains a static struct variable, instantiate it only for the first time when the function is called, and return the instantiated struct.
Shortly, I'm implementing Singleton with my struct. I will attach the code that I tested down here.

The wonder that I have is, 'Is itÂ  allowed by norms?' because I never used static variables before except for gnl project.
So I checked Norm V4 and there was a single line showing, 'Using global variables that are not marked const and static is forbidden and is
considered a norm error, unless the project explicitly allows them.'.

If I didn't misunderstand, norm says that static variables are forbidden unless the project explicitly allows it, but I focused on the word 'unless'.
I checked the get_next_line subject (English version) to check if this project is explicitly allowing the static variable, but I couldn't find any phrase that mentions 'you are allowed to use static variables'.

Now, I want to ask a peer's opinion on whether static variables are allowed or not.

PS: I am actually doing minishell project.

	printf("%p %d\n", get_test(), get_test()->nb);
	return (0);
